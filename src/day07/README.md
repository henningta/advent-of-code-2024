## Notes

Post-solution note: the algorithm I implemented would probably not hold up well to inputs with large lists of numbers in the equations being solved due to the pre-preprocessing of all the permutations. After reviewing another solution for comparison, I realized a better way to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming to track results through all possible permutations as the equation numbers are being iterated.

For example (pseudo-code):

```ts
// '||' character concatenates 2 numbers: 34 || 12 == 3412

function solve(equation: number[]) {
  if (len(equation) == 2) {
    return equation[0] +  equation[1] == target OR
           equation[0] *  equation[1] == target OR
           equation[0] || equation[1] == target
  }

  // operate on first 2 values in equation, then store result as first value to maintain current result value through each operation

  // subsequent iterations receive an updated equation array with the current result in the first index followed by the remaining numbers of the equation array

  add = solve([equation[0] + equation[1], ...equation[2:]])
  if (add) return true

  mul = solve([equation[0] * equation[1], ...equation[2:]])
  if (mul) return true

  concat = solve([equation[0] || equation[1], ...equation[2:]])
  if (concat) return true

  // if any return true, we have hit a successful base case where the final result of the equation matches the target value in question
}
```

This solution uses dynamic programming and recursion to continuously store all valid operations (in this case, adds, multiplies, and concatenations) into the first element of the equation numbers array. Each permutation is computed and stored through the iteration, and the base case is checked when only 2 numbers in the equation remain upon which to be operated: the current result of the permutation and the final number in the equation array.

This solution could also be optimized further to use an iterative approach instead of recursion.
